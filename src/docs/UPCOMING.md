# Upcoming AirGap Features:

## Seed XOR (New Social Recovery standard)

Seed XOR is a more powerful and standardized social recovery method than the previous one available in AirGap. It provides a higher level of security and protection for recovery phrases. By using XOR encryption and a streamlined interface, it simplifies the process of social recovery and ensures that your funds are always safe and secure.

## Hamming Backups (an enhanced Seed XOR version)

Hamming Backups is an enhanced variant of Seed XOR that provides an even higher level of security and protection for recovery phrases.

## Isolated modules

The Isolated Module is a game-changing feature for AirGap. This cutting-edge feature provides an unprecedented level of protection for your recovery phrase, by isolating every blockchain listed on the AirGap Vault in such a way that it can never be compromised.

What makes the Isolated Module so powerful, it allows each protocol/chain to run in its isolated context. This means that each protocol can only access and modify data within its context, and is unable to read or modify any data outside of it. This ensures that your sensitive information, such as your recovery phrase, remains completely secure and protected at all times. Another exciting aspect of the Isolated Module is its dynamic functionality. This feature enables users to add or remove modules and protocols as needed, allowing you to create a customized version of AirGap that meets your unique needs. For example, you could create a Bitcoin-only version of the AirGap Vault, which would only include the Bitcoin module. Additionally, the Isolated Module feature enables community contributions for the integration of new protocols, making it easier than ever to expand the capabilities of AirGap.
