## Introduction to Rootstock

Rootstock (also known as RSK) is a smart contract platform that is designed to bring smart contract capabilities to the Bitcoin blockchain. Rootstock aims to provide a Turing-complete virtual machine, similar to Ethereum's, that allows developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) and execute smart contracts on the Bitcoin network.

Rootstock achieves this by using a merge-mining mechanism, which means that miners can simultaneously mine both the Bitcoin and Rootstock blockchains. This merge-mining approach helps secure the Rootstock network by leveraging the existing hashing power of the Bitcoin network.

Rootstock also introduced its native token called "Smart Bitcoin" (RBTC), which is used to pay for transaction fees and gas costs within the Rootstock network. This token is pegged to Bitcoin at a 1:1 ratio, allowing users to move their Bitcoin onto the Rootstock platform and use it for smart contract activities.
